In this edition of *Convergence*, we feature a fascinating interview with Henry Yan about boarding life before, during, and after the pandemic, as well as an interview with Mr. MacDougall on the future of technology at our school post-COVID. The issue also includes a Year 8 student's account of his first day at the Upper School, interviews with the Athletic Steward and the Japanese Club, and an overview of blockchain technology and a related club at UCC. Last but not least, this issue features two wonderful Spanish bulletins from Ms. Rodriguez's Spanish classes as a way to celebrate the Latin American Heritage Month in Canada. These bulletins explore a wide range of student perspectives and experiences so far this year.
