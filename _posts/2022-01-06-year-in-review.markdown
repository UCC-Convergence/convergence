Back in December 2021, *Convergence* conducted our annual Year-in-Review Survey. Many students took it as an opportunity to reflect on and reminisce about the past calendar year. In this Special Issue, we publish the survey results together with all student comments about their views on a wide-range of social issues we faced together. The survey results also unveiled some fascinating changes between how students perceived 2020 and 2021 in eight important aspects. We hope you enjoy reading, and we wish you all the best for 2022!
