This issue of *Convergence* is about forming and maintaining social connections. It starts with an opinion piece regarding the advantages of Discord and its current status on campus, followed by an introduction to Mattermost as a social platform and two students' unique experiences keeping in touch with friends outside of school during the pandemic. The issue also includes a season recap for the Varsity Soccer Team, a showcase of some interesting new clubs at UCC, and a featured interview with our new Pluralism Coordinator.
