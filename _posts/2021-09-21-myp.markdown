Many students are new to the MYP or IB programs this year, and others might appreciate a quick refresher as well. As such, *Convergence* reached out to a few students who have extensive experience in the MYP and IB programs and asked them to share their tips, advice, and experiences. These students have written some thorough and insightful pieces, covering everything including coursework tips and test-taking strategies, as well as advice on how to deal with the MYP Personal Project, IAs, and the EE. We hope students find this special issue helpful for the new school year.
