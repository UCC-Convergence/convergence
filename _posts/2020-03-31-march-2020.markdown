Lots of changes are being implemented at UCC, including a new timetable and an updated, stricter policy for tardiness and cell phone usage. This *Convergence* issue details the reasoning behind these changes and what students can expect. In addition, this issue also covers the Skyky Charity Concert hosted by UCC students that raised $10,000 for SickKids Hospital.
