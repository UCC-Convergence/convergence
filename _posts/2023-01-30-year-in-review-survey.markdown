Before the Winter break, *Convergence* conducted the annual Year-In-Review Survey. It had a total of 10 questions and provided a look into the lives of UCC students in 2022. From the overall progress of humanity to the amount of sleep students have been getting, the survey was used to reflect upon the events of 2022. Because this survey was also conducted in 2021, we were able to compare the results between the two years through seven different components.
