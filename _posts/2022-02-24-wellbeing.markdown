We hear so much about wellbeing, almost on a daily basis, for good reason. In this edition of *Convergence*, we aim to share students' perspectives on wellbeing, with articles featuring the importance of getting outdoors, opinions regarding COVID restrictions and mental health, the role of community sports such as the Y11 basketball league and the National Ball Open, and an informative interview with Ms. Dobie on how to get sufficient sleep. The issue also highlights the power of investing and the Technical & Fundamental Analysis Club.
