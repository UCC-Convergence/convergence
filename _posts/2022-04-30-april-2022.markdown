The beginning of the 2022 Spring season involved a variety of changes inside and outside of our UCC community. With changes, new beginnings follow. However, these changes have yielded some controversy and have been nothing short of divisive. This April Issue of *Convergence* examines the Ukraine-Russia conflict from inside the UCC community in addition to the impacts of new school policies. There are articles featured on in-school fundraisers for Ukraine, the conclusion of a historic Tier 1B season, newly introduced school policy reminiscent of our pre-pandemic days, mental health, and finance, in addition to a Blue Page about the 20-Day schedule.
