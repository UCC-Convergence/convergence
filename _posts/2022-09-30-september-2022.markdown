As an introduction to the 2022-23 Academic Year, this September issue of *Convergence*, titled “New Waves,” provides a look into the new experiences, new faces, and new beginnings in the UCC Community. It features a collection of short-take interviews with the Portfolio Stewards and the Head Steward, along with an article highlighting our new Dean of Student Life and Well-Being, Dr. Adler. Furthermore, we interviewed Year 12 Harry Patel to learn about his European adventure with a few UCC classmates last June. At the end of the issue is our brand new “Photos” section, containing a few photos taken around the college and beyond since our last issue.
