The April issue features a piece by our graduating Co-Editor in Chief, Princeton Zhou, discussing his experience at UCC. The issue also includes an arts spotlight from the perspective of Ms. Macdonell, and Ms. Kaye, a glimpse of boarding life during the pandemic, and various perspectives on teaching during this unusual time from Ms. Evans, Mr. Jeffrey, and Mr. McCubbin.
