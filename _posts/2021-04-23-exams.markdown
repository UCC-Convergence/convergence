Due to the atypical learning models implemented over the past two semesters, the format (and even the existence) of end-of-year examinations has been a major area of debate among students and teachers for a while. In this *Convergence* Blue Page, we asked two Year 11 students to share their perspectives and opinions regarding the currently-planned model of Year 11 exams this year. They happened to offer some differing views. We hope that sharing these perspectives might be useful during the decision-making process if the school decides to re-evaluate the exam models, not only for Year 11 but for other grades as well.
