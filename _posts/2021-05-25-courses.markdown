Over the past year, our school has introduced several new courses, such as IB Global Politics, IB HL History, and Y10 Civics, and made significant changes to some others such as Y10 Science. After one full academic year, we at *Convergence* thought that it would be a worthwhile effort to interview teachers and students involved in these courses, so that they can share their opinions and perspectives on these new offerings. These interviews are included in this Special Issue.
