In this issue, *Convergence* is pleased to present the results from our "2020 In Review" survey, in which almost 200 students participated. The issue includes an infographic that summarizes the survey results, an editorial from *Convergence*, and all of the thoughtful comments left by students. These comments cover many aspects of student life at UCC and represent our passions, our anxieties, and our deep care for our UCC experience. This survey will become a yearly tradition at *Convergence*. In December 2021, we hope to hear everyone's thoughts again.
