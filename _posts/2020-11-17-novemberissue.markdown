This *Convergence* issue covers how UCC as a school has adapted to the start of an unusual school year and how its students are finding new means of social interaction. This issue also includes a Blue Page containing a Year 12's Perspective on the US Election, a faculty spotlight highlighting Dr. Hamr's legendary two decades at UCC, and an overview of two fast-growing finance-related clubs at our school.
